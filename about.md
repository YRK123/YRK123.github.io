I am a 12 year old student at Dr Challoners Grammar School in Amersham Buckinghamshire. My hobbies are playing Fortnite, doing Maths and playing Football 

### I made this blog to give weekly updates on my IT lessons and the progress I make on them. I hope you enjoy this.

A place to include any other types of information that you'd like to include about yourself.
