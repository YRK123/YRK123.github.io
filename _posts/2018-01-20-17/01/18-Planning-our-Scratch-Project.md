    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I have made previous scratch project using all different tools</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Try to begin to start applying the force of gravity to the game </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes I made my sprite drop down and move from one platform to another.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Yes I used gravity in real life to include real concepts such as terminal velocity</td>
  </tr>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I did not ask for any assistance and used my own knowledge to complete the goal given</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I thought about previous instances where I have seen gravity act upon an object</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I listened and contributed during the session</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have tried to make different stages within my game to make the player have a great time trying to pass the difficult levels within my game which would have made it a better experience to have. Also I could have included more real life topics such as friction to reduce the speed of the sprite and this would make the game more realistic. </td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to try and explore as far as possible to make the game more realistic for the user. Also I need to try and make special abilities or new movements for the sprite to give a unique twist on the game. This will prove to be clever idea. </td>
