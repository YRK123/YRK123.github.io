  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>In Primary school I made a maze on Scratch but I only know basic controls.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To understand more on what each code does and understand how to use it in a game</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target?</td>
    <td>Yes because I now know how to create movement and sprites disappear and then appear somewhere else.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Yes by not giving up and trying not to cheat by looking at others work</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Yes by thinking to myself if I did that, that would happen</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>By not just copying the answers of the demonstration because there would be no point in learning</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Yes by learning from my mistakes, for example, making the bullet appear where i want it to</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Yes by staying focused and wanting to achieve lots.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>If I didn't look for small details. Just do my common sense, like if I want it to go left, put the code in go left.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Research bits at home to see if they worked or not so in the lesson I know already what to do</td>
